# news-recommender-system

This work seeks to use the technique of creating knowledge graphs to recommend news and users. A knowledge graph was built from the MIND dataset through an initial pre-processing and storing it in a Neo4j database, which is based on graphs. After that, queries and an interaction interface for news and user recommendation were developed.
